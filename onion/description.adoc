hi. i'm 16 y.o. nerd and i use arch.
onion is my first dotfiles setup i ever created. in the beginning i did not
know it won't be the only one, and all those files used to be at the top
project's directory. but today, i decided that it is time to try and build
something completely new.
all files in this folder will be maintained, ofc.
[however, not going to edit this file. let it be a letter to future. hello,
me in 2033! how are you doing, man?]
